# Numerical Methods

**Legacy Project**

A basic windows form application written in c# feautring the following numerical methods:
- Bracketing Technique: Regula-Falsi Method
- Open Method: Secant Method
- Polynomial Technique: Muller's Method
- Matrix Decomposition Technique: Cholesky's Method
- Iterative Technique for System of Linear Equations: Gauss-Jacobi Method
- Regression Technique: Linear Regression
- Interpolation: Newton's Divided Difference Interpolating Polynomial
- Numerical Integration: Trapezoidal Rule
- Numerical Differentiation: Centered Finite Divided Difference

It is divided into 4 projects.
Please consult the doc file for more information.
